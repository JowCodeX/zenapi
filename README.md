## React App using JavaScript

I've created a react application that fetches quotes from the ZenQuotes API.
By consuming the ZEN API i am able to generate random quotes that i can display in my frontend (*webpage*)
By pressing the New Quote button you get a new random quote (**5 quotes are allowed every 30 seconds.**)

## To run the App
1. Download / Fork the repo.
2. Open it inside your editor.
3. In the Terminal, type **cd zenapi**
4. Inside the **zenapi** directory, type **npm install**
5. After a succesfull installation you are ready to start the application using **npm start**
6. Use the *New Quote* button to generate a new quote.
